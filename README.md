# Analysis-of-nutrient-dataset
A detailed analysis on creating a recipe recommendation system. 
The contemporary culinary scene is wide-ranging and multifaceted, with a multitude of recipes utilizing various ingredients, cooking methods, and cuisines. There is increasing interest in knowing the nutritional makeup of these dishes for the purpose to make educated nutritional choices as eating habits continue to change. To have a better knowledge of the dietary requirements of different recipes, we analyze a large range of nutritional data in this research paper. A broad variety of recipes from many culinary traditions are included in our dataset. Every recipe entry includes comprehensive details on the ingredients, fiber content, sodium content, and the macronutrient content (protein, carbs, and fats). Making use of this sizable dataset, our study aims to investigate several important areas pertaining to recipe nutritional content. First, we gather data regarding the distribution of significant nutrients in recipes using data visualization approaches. We investigated the relative proportions of the macronutrients for (fat, carbs, and protein) in the data set by visualizing how they are distributed using pie charts and histograms. These graphic aids offer important details regarding the usual nutritional makeup of dishes and indicate possible directions for further investigation. We'll then concentrate on finding dishes that are suited to dietary requirements or health issues. For instance, we are investigating the idea of diabetic-friendly recipes by developing standards based on the amount of sodium, fiber, and carbohydrates. These parameters allowed us to narrow down the data set and find recipes that adhere to the dietary recommendations for diabetics. Similarly, we are investigating low-lipid meals that are targeted for adults. Our research also examines the connection between recipe nutritional content and ingredients. We employ sophisticated data mining methods, including the Apriori algorithm, to identify popular ingredient combinations and how they relate to specific nutritional attributes. Our goal is to offer a more in-depth understanding of the factors influencing recipe nutrition by detecting patterns in ingredient utilization and how those patterns affect nutritional profiles. 
To sum up, our study offers an in-depth review of the nutritional data set and offers insightful knowledge on the nutritional value of recipes. We hope to create more educated nutritional choices, encourage better eating practices, and provide individualized recipe recommendations based on individual dietary requirements by utilizing data-driven methodologies.
